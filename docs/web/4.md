# Google-Images-Download 

## Background
To use the no code ai (lobe.ai), we need to get the proper images for the model.
There is a python library called the google-images-download.
But google-image-download no longer works after 2020. I found the solution so i want to share the content.

## Develop environment

- windows 10 
- miniconda3 (Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Windows-x86_64)

## Github issue

Unfortunately all 20 could not be downloaded because some images were not downloadable
[**Github Issue**](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download/issues/354).

## Solution 

Joeclinton1 solved the issue.
[Solution](https://github.com/Joeclinton1/google-images-download)

### Installation on windows

```bash
conda install selenium
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Joeclinton1/google-images-download.git
```

```bash
cd google-images-download
```

Open the windows cmd terminal.

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Add the index.py on the same folder.

```python title="/google-images-download/index.py"
from google_images_download import google_images_download   #importing the library

response = google_images_download.googleimagesdownload()   #class instantiation

arguments = {"keywords":"Polar bears,baloons,Beaches","limit":20,"print_urls":True}   #creating list of arguments
paths = response.download(arguments)   #passing the arguments to the function
print(paths)   #printing absolute paths of the downloaded imagess
```

You could see the downloads folder after the downloads are succeeded.
